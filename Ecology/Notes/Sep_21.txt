Overview:
    Core:
        Fall
            Sebastian: Single Species Ecology
            Graham: Population Genetics
            Artiem: Genomics
        Winter
            Gary: Species Interactions
            Sharon: Community Ecology
            Santiago: Behavior/Evolution
        Spring
            Michael: Macroevolution (maybe quantitative genetics)
            Brian, Annie: Phylogenetics


    Main goal:
        understand dist of a population abundance in time

        start with simplistic view: homogeneous populations
            everyone is identical, well mixed, no change in environment
        ex: sahara: vegetated --> desert
            bifurcation due to solar radiation

    Temporal Heterogeneity
        environment is changing over time, but still identical and well mixed
        ex: fluctuations due to precipitation, temp
        ex: rate of development of moths is dependent on temperature
        ex: number of seeds produced is dependent on precipitation
            evolution of life history.. try to 'hedge bets' against uncertainty

    Individual Heterogeneity
        individuals are potentially distinct, still well mixed, then may/may not include temporal heterogeneity
        age classes.. egg --> hatchling --> turtle
        sex classes
        size classes
        ex: sars: most infect few, few infect many

    Spatial Heterogeneity
        not well mixed.. spatial distribution models
        one flask is warmer than another, maybe some amount of mixing between two flasks
        three paradigms:
            metapopulation - Ilkka Hasnki (unoccupied/occupied patches)
            ideal free distribution - Milinski - extreme.. Sebastian clearly doesn't like it
            Sourcing dynamics (counterpart to IFD)

    ((post a few sentances on Canvas per reading by midnight the day before we discuss in class))
